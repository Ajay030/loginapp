/** 
 * Unified login re-router. Kicks in when login has been successful 
 * to re-route to the calling application.
 * 
 * Any application using Unified login must provide three
 * parameters - an, otk and rdr. These are described below
 *   an - The humand readable application name in UTF8 encoding
 *   otk - A random one time key, this is returned encoded in the 
 *         response
 *   rdr - The redirect URL. On successful login the user will be 
 *         sent here 
 * 
 * The rdr URL will receive a valid JWT token as the param jwt. It
 * can cross check this token by calling the checktoken API on the
 * unified login app (one time check only). This token should then 
 * probably be used to generate the app's own JWT or authentication
 * cookie etc. (whatever the calling app uses to track logins).
 * 
 * The JWT claims encodes the following, which are accurate if the JWT
 * verification returns true. Any JWT decoder can be used to decode JWT.
 *   id - This is user's ID (usually their email)
 *   name - The user's full name, as they typed during registration
 *   org - The user's parent org
 *   suborg - The user's sub org
 *   approved - If true, the user has been approved by the org they 
 *              belong to
 *   verified - If true, the user has verified their email
 *   onetimekey - The value of the otk param which was passed by caller
 *   appname - The value of the an param which was passed by caller
